    ##################
    
    
    A module that handles CSS rules which are
    defined in XRX widgets or portals
    
    Since this module is included by xrx.xql
    these functions and variables are visible 
    for all widgets, services, portals ...
:)

declare namespace xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml";
